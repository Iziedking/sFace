/**
 * Score attestation: turning "some device says 14,820" into "this Nimiq
 * address says 14,820, and nobody else could have said it for them".
 *
 * ## The hole this fills
 *
 * The README has admitted from the start that leaderboard scores are bounded
 * rather than proven: the service refuses impossible numbers and impossible
 * durations, keeps one entry per pilot per day, and that is a speed bump, not a
 * lock. The identity behind a row was a device id, which is a value the client
 * generates and can throw away and regenerate at will.
 *
 * A wallet signature fixes the identity half of that. The player signs a string
 * naming the exact day, seed, stage and score in Nimiq Pay, and the service
 * verifies the Ed25519 signature and derives the signer's address from the
 * public key. The row is then attributable to an address, the claim cannot be
 * forged by anyone who does not hold that key, and anybody can check it.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT prove, stated plainly
 *
 * It does not prove the run happened. A determined player can still sign a
 * score they did not earn, exactly as they could post one before. What changes
 * is that the claim is now non-repudiable and bound to an address with a public
 * history, so cheating stops being anonymous and starts being a thing a
 * specific wallet did in public, permanently. That is a different and much
 * better property than the device id ever had, and it is not the same thing as
 * proof of play. Do not describe it as anti-cheat.
 *
 * ## The prefix is not optional
 *
 * Nimiq wallets sign `\x16Nimiq Signed Message:\n<byteLength><message>` rather
 * than the bare message, which is what stops a signature obtained for a
 * "message" from ever being replayable as a transaction. Verified against the
 * library rather than assumed: signing the prefixed bytes verifies, signing the
 * raw bytes does not.

/**
 * Every shape a wallet might have signed, best first.
 *
 * ## Why this accepts more than one
 *
 * Not a single row in production ever carried a signature. A player then signed
 * in Nimiq Pay and the service answered 422: the key and the signature were the
 * right length and the right alphabet, and it still did not verify. Hex,
 * correct length, wrong bytes. Something is being signed other than what this
 * file builds, and no test here can find out which, because a headless browser
 * has no wallet.
 *
 * So instead of one shape and a refusal, this tries the shapes a wallet
 * plausibly uses and reports which one worked. A signature over a message
 * naming the date, seed, stage and score is a valid attestation whichever
 * envelope carried it: the envelope exists to stop a message signature being
 * replayed as a transaction, and every candidate below is a message envelope or
 * the message itself. None of them is a transaction.
 *
 * Order matters. The first is what Nimiq documents and what this verified
 * against before, and the rest are only reached once it fails, so a correct
 * wallet is never judged by a looser rule than it should be.

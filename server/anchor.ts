/**
 * Writing a score onto the chain, and checking one that claims to be there.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A signed score proves who set it. It does not put anything on a chain: the
 * signature is an Ed25519 message signature, it costs nothing, sends nothing,
 * and lives in this service's own database. Asked, fairly, what a Nimiq wallet
 * was actually for in a game that never moved any NIM, and the honest answer
 * was that it was an identity badge.
 *
 * An anchor is the real version. The player sends an ordinary Nimiq
 * transaction carrying their score in its data field. That produces a hash, an
 * entry on a public explorer, and a record nobody, including us, can quietly
 * change afterwards. Delete this service tomorrow and the anchored runs are
 * still there.
 *
 * ## Why the service parses the transaction instead of trusting a hash
 *
 * The obvious version takes a transaction hash from the client and stores it.
 * That proves nothing at all: a hash is a string, any string will do, and the
 * board would be publishing claims dressed as receipts. The settlement path
 * already has this limitation and says so out loud, because there it has no
 * choice.
 *
 * Here there is a choice. The wallet hands back the serialized transaction, so
 * the service can take it apart and check every field that matters:
 *
 *   the signature   proves the sender authorised it
 *   the sender      proves whose wallet it was
 *   the recipient   proves it was sent to the anchor and not to a friend
 *   the data        proves it names this exact run and not another
 *   the network     proves it is mainnet NIM and not test NIM
 *
 * Only then is the hash computed, from the bytes, rather than accepted. Every
 * one of those is a way to fake an anchor, and each is checked because leaving
 * any of them out makes the other four decorative.
 *
 * ## What it still cannot do
 *
 * It cannot tell whether the transaction was ever broadcast, or whether it was
 * included in a block. This service has no Nimiq node, the same limitation the
 * settlement path documents. So an anchor proves a transaction was properly
 * built and signed for the anchor address, and the explorer link is what
 * settles whether it landed. That is a much stronger claim than a reported
 * hash, and it is still short of a confirmation, so the screen says which one
 * it is making.

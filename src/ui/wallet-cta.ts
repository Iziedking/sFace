/**
 * The way out of a money path in a browser that has no wallet.
 *
 * Everything involving NIM in sFace happens in Nimiq Pay against the player's
 * own wallet: staking a challenge, settling one, unlocking a deep CT Signals
 * read. In a plain browser there is no provider, so all of those correctly
 * refuse.
 *
 * Refusing was where it used to stop. The player got an accurate sentence and
 * then had to work out for themselves what it meant, where to get the app, and
 * how to get back to what they were doing. That is a dead end with good manners.
 *
 * ## Three exits, because there are three situations
 *
 *   On a phone with Nimiq Pay      the deeplink opens it. One tap, done.
 *   On a desktop                   the deeplink does NOTHING. A custom scheme
 *                                  with no handler fails silently, so a lone
 *                                  button is a dead button for anybody judging
 *                                  this on a laptop. They get a QR to scan.
 *   No Nimiq Pay at all            the stores, named, not a bare URL.
 *
 * That middle case is the one that matters most right now: the people most
 * likely to open sFace on a desktop are exactly the people whose opinion of it
 * counts, and handing them a link their machine cannot follow is the difference
 * between "this works" and "this is broken".

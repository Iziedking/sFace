/**
 * Everything you would change about the app, rather than about your pilot.
 *
 * ## Why the toggles moved here after all
 *
 * This file used to argue the opposite: that sound and fullscreen should stay
 * on the home page because they are one-tap toggles you reach for mid-session,
 * and burying them would be a worse app arranged more neatly.
 *
 * The argument was right about the toggles and wrong about the total. Four
 * quiet buttons under six tiles under two sign-in actions under a primary
 * button is not a home page a stranger can read, and the cost of the tidying
 * is one tap on controls nobody uses more than once a session. Sound is set
 * once. Fullscreen is set once. The intro is replayed almost never.
 *
 * What is genuinely mid-run lives in the pause menu, which is where a player
 * actually reaches for it, and that has not moved.
 *
 * The split with Profile is state versus preference. Rank, Face, balance, clan
 * and gun are things you have, and they are next door. Everything here is a
 * thing you decide.
